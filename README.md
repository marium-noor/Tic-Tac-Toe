## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. **Starting the Game**: The game starts with an empty grid. Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell.

3. **Taking Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing their symbol on an empty cell.

4. **Winning**: The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row, and that player is declared the winner. If the grid is filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

5. **Reset**: After the game ends, you can reset the board to play again.
